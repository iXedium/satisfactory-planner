# Satisfactory Planner Style Refactoring Progress

## Main Goals
1. Refactor the styling architecture using ITCSS and BEM methodology
2. Improve maintainability through proper variable management and organization
3. Ensure consistent styling patterns across components
4. Maintain exact visual appearance and functionality throughout the refactor

## Completed Stages
1. Initial ITCSS Structure Setup
   - Created basic ITCSS layer structure
   - Set up main.scss with proper import order
   - Established settings, tools, generic, elements, objects, components, and utilities layers

2. Global Styles Migration
   - Migrated colors to SCSS variables in settings/_colors.scss
   - Created typography settings in settings/_typography.scss
   - Set up breakpoint system in settings/_breakpoints.scss
   - Established base reset styles in generic/_reset.scss

3. Z-Index System Implementation
   - Created settings/_zindex.scss with comprehensive z-index hierarchy
   - Established proper @use imports in component files
   - Updated components to use namespaced z-index variables
   - Removed global z-index imports in favor of component-level imports
   - Created comprehensive z-index documentation

4. Component Style Migration (In Progress)
   - Migrated ProductionNode styles to BEM methodology
   - Created _production-node.scss with proper structure
   - Updated component to use new BEM classes
   - Verified visual appearance and functionality

## Current Stage
- Continuing component style migration
- Tasks:
  1. Migrate ListView styles to BEM
  2. Migrate ItemIcon styles to BEM
  3. Update components to use new class names

## Upcoming Stages
1. Component Style Migration (Remaining)
   - Migrate remaining component styles
   - Verify all components use proper SCSS imports
   - Test all components after migration

2. Style Optimization
   - Audit and consolidate duplicate styles
   - Optimize responsive design patterns
   - Ensure consistent spacing using utilities
   - Review and optimize specificity

3. Final Review and Documentation
   - Conduct visual regression testing
   - Document component style patterns
   - Create style guide for future development
   - Final cleanup of unused styles

## Notes/Issues
### General Guidelines
- Always use @use for importing SCSS modules
- Follow BEM naming convention strictly
- Maintain existing functionality and appearance
- Document any potential breaking changes

### Known Issues
- Need to ensure proper z-index management in nested components
- Some components may need responsive design improvements
- Legacy CSS files need to be removed after migration
- Need to handle state-based styles consistently (e.g., hover, active states)

### Best Practices
- Use variables for all themeable properties
- Keep component styles modular and isolated
- Document complex style patterns
- Test all changes across different viewports

## Next Actions
1. Begin ListView component migration
2. Update component documentation
3. Continue updating progress tracker
